ENEA test

This code uses a DBSCAN clustering methode to separate the different wires. Once it is done, to find the mean plane of a wire we project the plot on the xy plane and find the director vector of the projection. Once we have this vector, we can use it as a new base vector with the z axis in order to have a 2D mathematical description of the wire. We now just have to optimize the model to the points.
